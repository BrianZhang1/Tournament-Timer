Hey!

Get this code into your editor, and run the html file. I hope you enjoy checking out some of the extra functions such as dark/light mode, custom times, a sound effect at the end, the way the code reformats as you resize the window, and some extra options you will soon find as you play around with it.

I also hope you like my code formatting, and I tried to make it as clean as possible without over flooding my code with comments.

The picture attached also shows a demo of my code if you want to see it in a picture format for any reason.

Cool.

P.S. I'm new to Javascript, HTML, and CSS, and my first time coding any of those languages or anything to do with web development, so if I had some weird formatting or weird coding habits, it's because I don't really know all the coding conventions for HTML.
